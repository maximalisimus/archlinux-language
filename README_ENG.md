#   ArchLinux Language
#   script setup

Creation date: 13.09.2019

This script is designed for quick localization of ArchLinux system 
in pseudographic mode, using the dialog package. 
I. e. quick installation / change of system language.

The script can be used with any Archlinux distribution. 
This wizard supports UEFI installation mode when you start ArchLinux in UEFI mode.

How to use this wizard?
1 important condition must be observed:
1) run as superuser

This script can be run from anywhere. 
It is enough to make one of the files executable and run it directly in the console.

$ chmod ugo+x language-master/language-setup.sh

$ sudo sh language-master/language-setup.sh

Then just follow the instructions of the installation wizard.

P.S.: Pay attention!

If you are using the project distribution 
"ArchISO" Live CD/DVD/USB in GUI mode, 
then, you must log out and log back in to complete the localization.

Good luck investing.
